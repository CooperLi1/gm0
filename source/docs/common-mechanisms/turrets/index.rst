Turrets
=====================

In FTC, people tend to refer to turrets as a mechanism that allows for the rotation of some other mechanism side-to-side. Generally, this is done for the purpose of positioning said mechanism for the purpose of scoring or intaking. For example, a shooter could be mounted on a turret to allow for shooter aim without turning the robot. Teams usually rotate these turrets by mounting a gear, sprocket, or pulley on the turret and then driving it using a motor or servos. 

The FTC community often splits these turrets into 2 categories, "full turrets" and "mini turrets." People often refer to turrets powered by motors or multiple servos at the base of the robot as "full turrets" and those powered by 1 or 2 servos as the end effector for some other mechanism, like slides or arms, as "mini turrets". Generally, when teams use the term "turret" without any other specification, they're referring to mini turrets.
