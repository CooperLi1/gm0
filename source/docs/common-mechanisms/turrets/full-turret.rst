Full Turrets
=====================

Listed below are common types of mechanisms often called "full turrets" or just "turrets" in the FTC community alongside their pros and cons. 

Lazy Susan Turrets
-------------

Lazy Susan Turrets are turrets that use a type of turntable called a lazy susan in order to rotate whatever is mounted on top of it.

Advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- Comes prebuilt, you can buy lazy susans online that already come built. You don't need to design your own turret mechanism which makes this an especially good option for teams that don't feel comfortable designing their own turret. It's also a great option for those with limited manufacturing capabilities.
- Cost, you can buy a decent lazy susan for relatively cheap.

Disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Customizability, because lazy susans are prebuilt, they're generally harder to customize than some other options
- Lateral Forces, lazy susans aren't designed to handle lateral forces, which means things like the reaction from shooting an object could wreck it.

Bearing Stack Turret
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bearing Stack Turrets are a type of turret with a plate spinning on a ring of bearing stacks to allow rotational movement. Bearing stacks are usually stacks of 3 bearings on a screw, shaft, or standoff that consist of a small bearing sandwiched between 2 bigger bearings. Usually, the small bearing is a radial bearing and the big bearings are thrust or radial bearings, depending on how much load teams expect the turret to have.

   Example Bearing Stack, a radial bearing is sandwiched between 2 thrust bearings on a shoulder screw, a plate will ride on the radial bearing whilst being supported by the thrust bearings.

Advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- Highly Customizable, because the turret is built custom, you can change it to fit your robot and mechanisms


Disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Manufacturing, building a bearing stack turret will likely require a lot of CAD and manufacturing to build
